/**
 * RockPaperScissors Game in Kotlin
 *
 * This Kotlin program simulates the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game allows
 * a player to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and then competes against the
 * computer's randomly generated choice. The winner is determined based on the game rules:
 * Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Simple console-based user interface.
 * - Random computer choice generation.
 * - Rules-based winner determination.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Run the program.
 * 2. Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) when prompted.
 * 3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
 * 4. The winner of the round is announced based on the game rules.
 * 5. Play again or exit the game as desired.
 *
 * Note: This is a basic implementation and can be extended with additional features
 * such as keeping track of scores, implementing a graphical user interface (GUI), or
 * adding more complex game variations.
